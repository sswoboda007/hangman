1. QUANTUM HANGMAN - Futuristic GUI Game
Concept: Modern, cyberpunk-themed word guessing game with neural interface aesthetics.

Features / Files:

- wordBank.py – provides 15 themed word categories with 150+ words (general, animals, fruits, movies, countries, science, winter 2025, minecraft, among us, fortnite, coding, space, superheroes, fantasy, ocean)
- gameLogic.py – handles guesses, tracking used letters, win/loss conditions, hint system, auto-reveal of RSTLNE letters
- uiTkinter.py – modern GUI with futuristic theme, cyan/purple/pink color scheme, quantum/neural interface design
- ioCli.py – CLI interface for text-based gameplay
- main.py – wires everything together, supports both GUI and CLI modes
- hangmanTests/ – comprehensive test suite with 49 tests
  - test_wordBank.py – word bank functionality
  - test_gameLogic.py – game logic and rules
  - test_uiTkinter.py – GUI interface testing
  - test_ioCli.py – CLI interface testing
  - test_main.py – main module wiring

UI Features:
- High-tech cyberpunk theme with black background and neon colors
- Resizable window (720x1320 default, min 650x1200)
- Fully visible 3-row virtual keyboard with modern styling
- Animated hangman drawing with quantum/neural aesthetics
- Score tracking and energy-based hint system
- Category selection with themed word lists
- Visual feedback for correct/incorrect guesses

Good for tests:
- Verifying win/loss when last guess is used
- Checking display of partially guessed words
- Ensuring letters can't be guessed twice
- Testing random word selection with seeding
- UI component interactions and state management
- Theme consistency across all visual elements

How to Run:
python main.py              # run the futuristic GUI
python main.py -c           # run the CLI

Testing:
python -m pytest hangmanTests/    # run all tests with pytest
python -m pytest hangmanTests/test_uiTkinter.py -v  # run UI tests with verbose output
python -m unittest discover hangmanTests  # alternative test runner

Project Setup:
- Python 3.12+ required
- Uses tkinter for GUI (included with Python)
- No external dependencies required
- 100% test coverage with 49 passing tests

Recent Updates (Dec 2025):
- Transformed from 90s aesthetic to 2026 futuristic design
- Implemented high-tech cyberpunk theme with neon colors
- Expanded word bank with modern gaming and seasonal themes
- Fixed keyboard layout issues - all rows now visible
- Made window resizable with proper minimum dimensions
- Removed bonus matrix for cleaner interface
- Updated all tests to match new UI design

🎮 Planned Reward System Features:
🏆 Neural Synapse Progression (NP System)
- XP-based leveling with thematic ranks (Neural Initiate → Data Runner → Cipher Agent → Quantum Hacker → Neon Oracle → Singularity).
- Earn "Neural Points" (NP): +10 (Win), +5 (Efficiency: <3 errors), +2 (Correct Letter), -2 (Loss).
- Level Unlocks (1-10+): New categories (Fortnite at Lvl 3, Fantasy at Lvl 5), Neon schemes, and "Quantum Glitch" animations.
- Perks: High-level players start with extra hints or additional auto-revealed letters.

⚡ Daily Challenges & Quantum Surges
- Daily Challenge: Specific goals (e.g., "Science category, no errors") for Double NP.
- Weekly Streak: Play 5 days in a row for temporary boosts (e.g., extra guesses).
- Quantum Surge: Random events or seasonal (Winter 2025) triple NP multipliers.

🎨 Unlockable Cosmetics & Perks
- Themes: Midnight Neon, Toxic Green, Sunset Protocol, Chrome Future.
- Skins: Hologram, Neon Skeleton, Glitch, Golden Circuit.
- Functional: Spend NP to "recharge" hint energy faster.

🏅 Achievement & Badge System
- "Quantum Survivor": Win 5 games in a row (+50 NP).
- "Neon Decoder": Win without hints (Unlock "Elite" word list).
- "Category Master": Complete all words in a category (Custom avatar/icon).
- "Daily Hacker": Play daily for a week (Free hint refill).
- Visual achievement gallery with progress tracking.

💾 Persistent Neural Core (Save System)
- JSON-based persistence (`neural_core.json`) tracking NP, levels, achievements, and streaks.
- Integration: `gameLogic.py` for scoring, `uiTkinter.py` for progress bars and notifications.
- Time-tracking via Python's `datetime` module for daily/weekly resets.

🎰 Bonus Multiplier System
- Score multipliers for: No wrong guesses (×2.0), No hints (×1.5), Speed wins (×1.3), Win streaks (×1.2).
- Stacking multipliers up to ×4.68 for maximum NP potential.
